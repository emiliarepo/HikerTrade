# HikerTrade

This is a console application built as part of a Sievo internship assignment. The application allows hikers to swap items during their hike, following predefined rules: the hikers can't be injured, they must swap all their items and their items must be worth the same total value.

Install .NET 9.0, install the dependencies, build and run the project.
